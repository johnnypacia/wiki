Well, it was there I found Beside the Alamo Enchantment strange as the Blue up above, For that moonlit pass That only he would know Still hears my broken song of love. Moon in all your splendor, Known only to my heart, Call back my rose, Rose of San Antone! Lips so sweet and tender, Like petals fallin apart, Speak once again of my love, my own Broken song, Empty words I know Still live in my heart all alone, For that moonlit pass by the Alamo, And rose my rose of San Antone!"},
